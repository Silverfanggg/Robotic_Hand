# Bionic Hand with ESP32 and ESP-NOW
- This project is a real-time (low latency) bionic hand control system using ESP32 and ESP-NOW communication. A gauntlet worn on the userâ€™s hand includes potentiometers connected to each finger through mechanical linkages. As the fingers move, the potentiometers rotate, and the ESP32 reads these changes via its ADC. The values are then transmitted wirelessly using ESP-NOW to another ESP32 on the robotic hand, where the data is mapped to servo motors that replicate the finger movements by rotating to the corresponding angles. This setup enables low-latency, wireless, and natural finger tracking, making it suitable for applications such as prosthetics, robotics, and gesture-based interaction.
